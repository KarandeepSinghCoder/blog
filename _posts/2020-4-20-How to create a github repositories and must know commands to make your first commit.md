Hi everyone I know how confusing github seems at the bigning and every little comand seems to confuse you.

The Git environment is a vast and sometimes gets very complicated when you have to work on bigger projects. These days almost every software company use github as their first version controlling system.

Lets first konw what a repositry is.

<h3>So what is a repo</h3>
A directory or repo is a storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.” You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.

<h3>So now what is a commit</h3>
This is the command that gives Git its power. When you commit, you are taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time,and finally push it to your repo this makes necessary updates inside your repo. Thus it helps store your projects and provide version controle power.
