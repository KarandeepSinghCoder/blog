Hi below are the few Awesome sites which I use in my day to day life. These are the sites that help me do my work easily or in someway Useful for me. Most of them help save my efforts while writing code or doing assignments.

<a href="https://spinbot.com/">1) SpinBoat</a>

 Spinbot is a free, automatic article spinner that will rewrite human readable text into additional, readable text. This always helps me to spin some of the text of my friend's assignment and saves me a lot of time and effort, Therefore its my all time favorite site.

<a href="https://cloudconvert.com/">2) cloudconvert</a>

 CloudConvert is an online file converter. They do support nearly any audio, video, document, ebook, archive, image, spreadsheet or presentation format. This site helps me convert almost all types of files from one format to another so easily. This is a much needed site in VIT to survive.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">3) w3schools</a>

 By far the best website to learn Python, PHP, jQuery, Java, CSS and Bootstrap. Thanks to my friend Yash who suggested me to learn python from W3schools, believe me this will help you understand more than your professors can make you understand. 

<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm">4) tutorialspoint</a>

Also an alternative to w3school.You can learn any language using this site. I used it to learn c language and it really helped.

<a href="https://www.protectedtext.com/">5) protectedtext.com</a>

ProtectedText is a free online notepad with password, where you can securely save your notes on the web. It's a secure notepad with a password, for all your notes, ideas, to-do lists, scripts, etc. You can store notes online at ProtectedText.com/ANY_SITE_YOU_TYPE and access from any web browser. It's free and also without ads and tracking, and you don't even have to register or have any kind of account. Store your notes anonymously and encrypted in this simple and secure free online notepad. You can also use our Android app to access your notes conveniently from your Android device.

I store my daily task, some deadlines of my DA's, By far the best form of digital notepad which you can access from literally anywhere, the only thing you need is an internet connection. 

Its a life saver because it works on our Labs also, so you can easily understand the other things for which it can be used.  

<a href="https://bitly.com/">6) bitly.com,</a> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/">tinyurl.com</a>

These are the two best and free url shortners which I use to add small urls to my notes on pdf. This helps me see some important YouTube videos which I may have forgotten to see otherwise.

7) Below are the few common sites which are very popular among the coders, this helps to improve your job profile as well as your skills.

i><a href="https://github.com/">github</a>
It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. Your progress on git hub adds a lot to your job profile as it tracks the amount of open source codes you did.

ii><a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/">Hackerearth, </a><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank</a>, <a href="https://codeforces.com/">codeforces, </a><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow. </a>
As a CSE Grad these are the sites where you need to get your hands dirty. You can choose either of hackerearth or hackerrank, I personally prefer Hackerearth. Start your competitive coding skills on either of the two and ultimately get into codeforces and earn reputation, a good reputation on this platform can make you stand ahead of the other students in your university while placements.
