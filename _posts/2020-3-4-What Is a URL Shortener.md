title: What Is a URL Shortener
---
A URL shortener is basically a way to make a long URL (Uniform Resource Locator) shorter.  URL shortening services are Web tools (or services) that allow you to provide a long URL to a specific webpage and obtain a much shorter URL from the service provider.

<h2>How Does a URL Shortener Work?</h2>

A URL shortener works due to a Web server work called a "Divert" (URL redirection). Essentially the new URL (the short URL) will divert clients to the old URL (your long URL). At the point when you enter a URL a program, this really sends a HTTP order to the Web server guiding it to get and transmit the mentioned Web page. There are a progression of divert HTTP reaction codes that a server can return, including the accompanying: 

- 301: (changeless) Returns a lasting sidetrack status showing that the asset has moved for all 	time. 

- 302: (temp) Returns an impermanent divert status. 

- 303: (see other) Returns a "See Other" status demonstrating that the asset has been supplanted.
